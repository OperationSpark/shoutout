Shout Out - Design Elements
========

Shout Out is an app available on both iOS and Android created by Operation Spark to serve as an intro into native app development using the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/). 

## User Experience
User Experience (UX) involves a person's behaviors, attitudes, and emotions about using a particular product, system or service. In regards to web products the user experience encompasses every interaction you have with a product. That includes not only while using the application itself but also the emails you receive, how easy the login flow may be, and how soon you get a response after submitting a support request.  

### User Stories
A user story is an explanation, in a few sentences, of what a user needs to do while using a product. User stories are common in agile software development and answer the question of who, what, and why in a simple way. 

Examples user stories: 
**Dropbox**
As a user, I can *easily* sync files across all of my devices.

**Facebook**
As a user, I can see *easily* what my friends and family are up to and share my own experiences. 


### User Interface
The user interface is the space where interaction between humans and machines occurs. Humans should be able to easily control machines and receive feedback on the best way to proceed.

## Colors
Colors are important. Different colors evoke different emotions, provide varying amounts of contrast, and ultimately have a major affect on *how users feel* while using a product.

## Logos
A logo is the graphical mark used to represent your brand. Logos are either purely graphical, using just a symbol, purely text-based, or both.
